    "# Lab 3 - Elements of Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the third lab where we will start covering the elements of visualization. We will look at the data types and visual variables, and learn how to use visual variables to effectively represent data. For this lab, we will refer to the slides in the file  [L3_DataViz_Elements.pdf](L3_DataViz_Elements.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Sets and Data Types \n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the taxanomy of data sets and data types is the key to choose the right variables to visually represent them. In the previous lab we have seen that understanding the nature of the data helps us to choose the most efficient color palette, similarly choice of visual variables depend on the data types and data set types. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data sets can be analyzed in a number of different taxanomies; one such categorization is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 1D data: this is the data set type with only one dimension; it can contain a set (arbitrary order), or a sequence (defined order). It can also contain 1D time series data, although one might want to treat temporal data as a separate data type. \n",
    "\n",
    "* 2D data, 3D data, nD data: Main difference between 2-3D data and multidimensional data is the ease of visualization. 2D and 3D data cna be directly visualized whereas representing data in more than 3 dimensions require either data reduction, cluster visualization techniques, or use of separable visual variables. A special type of 2D data is spatial data where dimensions correspond to geographical locations. 3D data may also refer to the data used for volume rendering for scientific visualization. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Temporal data: This can be simply 1D data or may have more dimensions that have intrinsic temporal meaning. There are some visualization techniques more suitable for temporal data so this type of data set can be treated as a separate type. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Graphs: This type of data sets contain entities and relations between entities that can be visualized as graphs (networks, trees). \n",
    "\n",
    "* Text: Text itself can also be a data set and special visual representations can be used to visualize it (e.g. word clouds).\n",
    "\n",
    "As we will see later, there are other taxanomies possible for data sets. For example according to one taxanomy, one type is *table* which includes 1D, 2D, 3D, nD, and temporal data set types, and another type is *network* which is the graph type we discussed above. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Types \n",
    "\n",
    "Each data set can contain different data types; for our current discussion, we categorize the data types in three ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Nominal: This is the data type that has no intrinsic ordering, and usually no quantitative value. It is also called categorical type, or label type. An Example of this data type would be a **fruits** attribute in a data set where it takes values such as *apples*, *oranges*, *bananas*, etc. If a data set has a category or class attribute, it is usually nominal. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Ordinal: This data type obeys a < relation; the items can be ordered, even though they are not necessarily numerical. For example an attribute of **length** can be *tall*, or *regular*, or *short*, or an attribute of **density** can be *high*, *mid*, or *low*. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Quantitative: this data type are numbers with which we can do arithmetic. It is meaningful to add them and compute ratios. There are two types:\n",
    "    * Interval: this type of data does not have a \"true zero\". We can't compare them directly; only the distance between two data items can be compared meaningfully. For example, **location** is a type of data that has no \"beginning point\"; we can compare the distance between two locations. **Date** is similarly interval data type.\n",
    "    * Ratio: This type has fixed zero, origin is meaningful. Comparisons are made by computing the ratio, or proportion of some measure. For example, **length** and **mass** are ratio types; **length** is the measurement of some entity in proportion to a unit length. \n",
    "    \n",
    "### Data Model vs. Conceptual Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Data model is the low level description of a data type; for example 1D floats, or 2D integers, etc. Conceptual model is the semantics of the data type: what it represents, or how to reason with it. For example, a **temperature** attribute can be represented by a numeric data model such as 77.5, 32.4, -4.3. Its conceptual model tells us what does numbers mean, and what we can do with them. On the other hand, **temperature** can be represented with different data types, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Quantitative: it can be floating point numbers measured in a continuous space with some unit (e.g. Fahrenheit).\n",
    "* Ordinal: in some data set **temperature** may only be represented as *hot*, *warm*, *cold*, etc. We can still order this data type.\n",
    "* Nominal: If **temperature** has a slightly different meaning in a data set corresponding to the state of some physical object, one could use *burned*, or *not burned* and this type of data is categorical, there is no ordering. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to understand the conceptual model of the data set attributes in order to classify them into one of the above data types. Not all numeric values are *quantitative*, for example. Take a look at the example in **slide #5** in [L3_DataViz_Elements.pdf](L3_DataViz_Elements.pdf):\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Order date** is a *quantitative* attribute; it is an interval type. We can compute the difference between two dates, and we can order them. \n",
    "* **Order priority** and **Product Container** attributes are *ordinal*; we can order them even though they are not numbers. \n",
    "* **Order ID** seems to be a quantitative attribute; but in fact it is not. Even though it's numeric, the actual ID number is only a label, there is no point in adding two order IDs, for example. One might think that it's ordinal as in it can be ordered, but an Order ID can contain any arbitrary numbers to represent things such as customer number, store number, etc. This attribute is *nominal*. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Visual Variables \n",
    "\n",
    "In written communication, we use letters that represent sounds, and when arranged in a particular way they represent spoken words. Similarly, there are also visual \"letters\" in visual communication that can be arranged in order to convey information. They are called *visual variables* or *channels*. They were first developed for cartography by a French cartographer Jaques Bertin. He describes **marks** as the basic units to represent some information, and *visual variables* to modify these marks. \n",
    "**Marks** are points, lines, areas, surfaces, volumes, links, and containment. Visual variables modify these marks to encode data. Here are Bertin's visual variables: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Position**: Position encodes the location of a mark (e.g. point). It is the strongest visual variable, as we can easily distinguish points in different locations, group them, estimate the distance between them, and naturally understand the distribution of data by looking at them. A scatter plot is a visualization that uses the *position* visual variable to encode 2D data, for example. *Position* is a suitable visual variable for all data types. For example, a scatter plot does not have to have numerical axes, we can still distinguish between marks, and group them easily when looking at the positions of the points that represent data items in a 2D plot. <img src=\"../images/position.png\">In the above example, we can easily distinguish between A, B, C; we see that B is between A and C, and we can estimate that BC is twice as long as AB. All this information is simply encoded by the positions of A, B, C. One problem with *position* is that in can lead to a cluttered view of data for too many data points. We will see how we can deal with that later. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Size, Length, Area**: These three are good visual variables. They can encode data to make it easy to compare (such as big vs. small), and they support perceptual grouping (review previous week) and hence they are efficient variables for preattentive processing. They give us the ability to judge differences, for example aligned bars give us instant comparison between two data items. Similarly, even if not aligned, change in length of a mark is a good visual representation to compare the data items. Changes in area are still preattentive, but harder to judge linearly. For example, circles of different size can encode data items, but it's harder for human visual system to judge if a circle is twice as big as another one in comparison to two aligned bars. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Shape**: Shape is good for representing nominal data types. It does not support ordering, or grouping. We cannot naturally order shapes such as a star is greater than a circle, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Texture**: Texture is a visual variable that should be used when only black and white representation is available as it can get very confusing if using too many textures on a map for example. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Value**: This is actually the grayscale (lightness) variable. If used for nominal data types, it can be preattentive (stands out) for a small number of values. Too many shades are not easily distinguishable, and also gives the impresion of ordering, so it should not be used for nominal type if the number of categories is big. It is also very useful visual variable for quantitative data type. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Color**: Color in the domain of maps (cartography) is surprisingly not as strong variable as the size or position. we have seen the pitfalls regarding the use of color previously. Its use for nominal, ordinal, and quantitative data should follow the guidelines we discussed in the previous week. We should try to avoid color if we can encode our data by using position, size, and length variables for data sets with few attributes. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics of Visual Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of visual variable to encode a data type depends on its characteristics (**slide #7** in [L3_DataViz_Elements.pdf](L3_DataViz_Elements.pdf)):\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Selective**: Does this visual variable make the mark easily distinguishable from others? Shape and color are selective visual variables; we can easily distinguish marks with different colors, for example. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Associative**: Does this visual variable support perceptual grouping? Position is an associative visual variable, we preattentively group marks together based on their positions. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Quantitative**: Can the difference between two marks in this visual variable be quantified, or interpreted numerically? Length is a visual variable that is quantitative. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Order**: Does the visual variable support ordering? Size and area are orderable visual variables. Color can be ordered if a quantitative color palette is chosen. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Mackinlay's Visual Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Jock D. Mackinlay extended this list of visual variables to contain angle, slope, volume, density, saturation, hue, connection, and containment. These variables are all preattentively processed. He also provided a sorting for their accuracy depending on the data type they are used for.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/mackinlay.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, length has little use for nominal data type, but is very accurate for encoding the quantitative data type. Position is very good for all data types. Texture and shape are not useful at all quantitative type, but good for nominal, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "For interactive or animated visualizations, *motion* became a new visual variable that is also preattentitvely processed. Changes in motion such as direction, speed, frequency, etc. are processed preattentively, and can encode data efficiently. \n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at the  **slide #13** in [L3_DataViz_Elements.pdf](L3_DataViz_Elements.pdf) for another ordering of the visual variable efficiency. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following plot, called Steven's Power Law, depicts the physical stimulus versus its perceived intensity or strength by us. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/powerlaw.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Human visual perception underestimates the area and volume, as opposed to the estimation of length which is pretty accurate (linear). This shows why Length is a stronger visual variable than size. we should keep the characteristics of visual variables and the data types when choosing visual variables to encode data. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Separability of Visual Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "We can combine multiple visual variables to encode more attributes. The question becomes which visual variables can be combined and still be preattentively processed? The following shows some examples of marks and visual variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/channels.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "First plot from left uses the lines as the *mark* and length and position as the *visual variables*. Second plot uses the points as the *mark* and position as the *visual variable*. Third plot combines two *visual variables*: position and color. Fourth plot combines three *visual variables*: position, color, and size. So far these combinations of visual variables can still be preattentively processed, but as we increase the number of variables (e.g. adding different shapes, shades, etc.) there will be major interference between visual variables and human visual system will not be able to preattentively process these channels; it will have to consciously go through each channel sequentially to understand and reason reducing the effectiveness of the visualization. The number of channels does not have to be large for interference either; imagine using reactangles as *marks* and using height and width of the rectangle as two *visual variables* to encode two different attributes. This also creates some interference as we perceive rectangles as a whole and hence have hard time to separate two visual variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next week, we will look at effective visualization design principles. **Slide #14** in [L3_DataViz_Elements.pdf](L3_DataViz_Elements.pdf) shows some examples of ineffective visualizations that we will discus in the next module. \n",

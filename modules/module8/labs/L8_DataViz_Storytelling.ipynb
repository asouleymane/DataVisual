    "# Lab 8 - Storytelling with Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will see how to put everything together and create a *narrative visualization* that tells a \"story\" with the data. We create visualizations to give a message, make a point, or convince the audience. We will see how we can do that in addition to creating effective visualizations as we have seen in the previous modules. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visualization Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "In the beginning, we started with the **types and the impact** of the visualization. We have seen that we can use visualization in conjunction with data science in two major ways: **exploratory** vs. **explanatory** visualization. Data visualization is not just about showing data, it's about giving a message, making a point, convincing an audience by using the data; so there is a *story* to be told with data visualization. A whole bunch of charts/plots that look like randomly placed do not tell a story. We need to use design elements such as captions, text annotations, layout, etc. to help tell the story better. We need to provide a **context** and **explain** what the visualization shows. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data storytelling is a structured approach for communicating data insights, and it involves a combination of three key elements: data, visuals, and narrative. When narrative is coupled with data, it helps to explain to the audience what’s happening in the data and why a particular insight is important. When visuals are applied to data, they can enlighten the audience to insights that they wouldn’t see without charts or graphs. When narrative and visuals are merged together, they can engage the audience.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Definitions and Model \n",
    "\n",
    "A *story* consists of ordered sequence of steps (text, image, visualization, video, etc.) and a defined path through these steps. There is a difference between the Journalism model of storytelling and Data Science model of storytelling: \n",
    "\n",
    " - Journalists collect information through research, interviews, etc to assemble the key facts and tie together the key facts (raw material) to produce a story supported by visualizations (e.g. infographics)\n",
    "\n",
    " - Data scientists use visualization to explore, analyze, and gain insight about data (exploratory); and also to present the results of the analysis (explanatory) to communicate a message, or make a point.\n",
    " \n",
    "A *narrative visualization* has a visual structure (or *genre*) to support the story, interaction to engage the story, and the message to tell the story. Here are the seven genres of narrative visualization:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/genres.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "If a narrative visualization is **author driven**, it has a stronger order (linear, etc.), heavy messaging, and minimal interaction; whereas if it is **reader driven**, it has weaker order, lighter messaging, and more interactive elements to let the reader to explore and query. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a taxonomy of visualization with respect to storytelling elements: \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/elems.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Telling a story with visualization requires:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Ordering and structure: clear path for the audience to follow and focus attention.\n",
    " - Messaging: providing context explaining data, and emphasizing reasons by adding text annotations and captions.\n",
    " - Visual elements: preattention, effectiveness, visual channels, layering, levels of detail, what-how-why, small multiples, etc.\n",
    " - Consistency: visual elements, and different types of graphs should be connected by a common visual thread (color schemes, fonts, types of graphs, etc.)\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "Here is an example of a simple visualization that does not give a message, or tell a story:\n",
    "### BEFORE\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/before4.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "After we do the following, it becomes easier to understand, because now it tells a story using visual and textual elements. \n",
    "\n",
    " - Replace title with a message\n",
    "\n",
    " - Annotate with text to provide context \n",
    "\n",
    " - Order the data for easy consumption\n",
    "\n",
    " - Label axes \n",
    "\n",
    " - Eliminate clutter\n",
    "\n",
    " - Use color \n",
    "\n",
    "### AFTER\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/after4.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Let's see more examples of that: **\n",

    "## Narrative Visualizations with Multiple Elements \n",
    "\n",
    "We can have multiple graphs/plots to tell a story by tying them together within a layout. We have to make sure that it does not become too cluttered or cognitively loaded for the audience to follow the path of the story. \n",
    "\n",
    " - Pay attention to the path: make it clear where it starts (the more linear layout the more it looks like story)\n",
    " - Consistent visual framework: keep things tidy, simple, and consistent throughout the different elements\n",
    " - Provide context: both the story aspect by adding text annotations and the numerical aspect by providing levels of scales. \n",
    " - Use highlighting techniques: layering by color, zooms, insets, framing, etc. \n",
    " - Use perceptual grouping to your advantage. \n",
    " - Use headlines, captions, annotations: stories are told by words and sentences. \n",
    " - Adjust level of detail and precision with respect to the message.\n",
    " - Make interactive elements visually clear and do not let them obscure the data. \n",
